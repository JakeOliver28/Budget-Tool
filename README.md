# Finance Automation Project

Currently in progress  
Using Python and Flask to create a web app with below goals.
I'm using the blog web app created in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) as a starting point.

## Potential Goals for Project
Display monthly budget and monthly spending/income side-by-side  
Display total spending per month over the course of a year  
Display total spending on certain budget categories and certain locations
